# TextMemoApp

TextMemo is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) based application that extracts text from images.   
Users can either select an image from the gallery or capture a photo using the camera to extract text.   
This application is built with React Native (Expo) + Express.js and utilizes Google Cloud Vision API for OCR processing.

## Tech Stack
### Category : Technology
- Frontend : React Native (Expo), JavaScript
- Backend : Express.js, Node.js
- Data Storage : File System (Local Uploads)
- OCR : Service Google Cloud Vision API
- Deployment : Render (Backend & Frontend)

## Key Features
- Extract text from images - Uses Google Vision API
- Select images from the gallery - Supports file uploads
- Capture and process text instantly - Real-time camera capture
- Preview extracted text in-app - View OCR results immediately
- Works on both Web & Mobile - Built with Expo for cross-platform support

## Installation & Setup
### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/TextMemo.git
cd TextMemo
```
### 2. Run the Frontend
```
cd frontend
npm install
npx expo start
```
- For web mode:
```
npx expo start --web
```
### 3. Run the Backend
```
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```
## Environment Variables (.env)
To use Google Cloud Vision API, create a .env file and set the API key path.
```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./path/to/your-service-account.json
```
For Render deployment, make sure to set up environment variables correctly.

## API Endpoints
```
POST /api/upload-base64
Content-Type: application/json
{
"image": "base64EncodedString"
}
```
### Response Example
```
{

## Deployment Guide
### Build Frontend & Move to Backend
```
cd frontend
npx expo export
rm -rf ../backend/web-build
mv dist ../backend/web-build
```
### Deploy on Render
```
Deploy Backend
Deploy the backend folder on Render
Set up environment variables (GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS)
Include the web-build folder in the backend
```
```
Deploy Frontend
Build the web version using Expo (npx expo export --web)
Move web-build to backend
Serve static files from the backend
```
## Troubleshooting
### PayloadTooLargeError: request entity too large
Solution: Increase upload size limit in server.js:
```
app.use(express.json({ limit: "50mb" }));
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: "50mb" }));
```
### No file uploaded. Error
Solution:
- 1. Ensure Content-Type is set to application/json
- 2. Use base64 encoding for image uploads
### expo build:web Error
Solution:
Expo CLI has changed. Use the new command:
```
npx expo export --web
```
